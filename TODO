Desired features:
  - When shuffle active, start with random song (currently first)
  - Better colorscheme (currently gvim darkocean)
    * Also radio buttons (or equiv) along top (or somewhere) that change the style.
  - GET params that queue up a playlist and song.
  - Hover/click something for list of controls.
  - Songs list expands horizontally with available space.
  - Songs and Playlists tabs can be "minimized" by clicking on them.

"Features":
  - audio.js doesn't keep track of the playlist, so switching away has undefined behavior.

Known bugs:
  - ensureSelectedVisible() is wonky, I think.  Keyboard selection doesn't work well on large lists, e.g., "Classical"
