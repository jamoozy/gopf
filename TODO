Desired features:
  - Better colorscheme (currently gvim darkocean)
    * Also radio buttons (or equiv) along top (or somewhere) that change the style.
  - GET params that queue up a playlist and song.
  - Legend for quick keys.
  - Songs and Playlists tabs can be "minimized" by clicking on them.  (purpose?)
  - Shift-click selects multiple playlists. (purpose?)
  - <link> prefetch next song.
  - bokaj@: custom queue
  - bokaj@: shuffle ALL songs
  - Redundancy-checking within a playlist.
    * Idea: check if currently- and next-played songs are the same with cmp.
    * If they are, print a warning to a log file.
    * (manually) Occasionally check the file and delete the undesirable one.

"Features":
  - audio.js doesn't keep track of the playlist, so switching away has undefined behavior.

Known bugs:
  - ensureSelectedVisible() is wonky, I think.  Keyboard selection doesn't work randomly on various arch.'s.
  - After song selected, previously-selected song still displayed but not played.
  - size of songs/playlists too small by 1px.
  - When shuffle active, start with random song (currently first)
